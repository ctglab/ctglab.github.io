Gliomas, characterized by diverse clinical outcomes and limited effective therapeutic options, represent highly heterogeneous brain tumors. This project seeks to demonstrate the benefits of integrating multi-omics data within an AI-based framework, providing insights into tumor complexity across various biological dimensions. The ultimate goal is to develop a tool that predicts glioma patient outcomes by integrating imaging, clinical, and fluid biomarkers, thus facilitating personalized therapeutic decision-making. Supported by funding from Regione Toscana and the Institute of Informatics and Telematics of CNR in 2022-2024, this collaborative initiative involves Siena Imaging Srl, with expertise in MRI biomarker development. Starting from March 2024, the project will be undertaken with funding from Advanced Robotics and enabling digital TEchnologies & Systems (ARTES) 4.0.
